Krauter
=======

New router implementation for Rails.  Works on very simple principles of data structuring.  Read the code (it's only 200 lines!)

TODO
=======

* Route globbing
* Don't worry with trying to interpolate params if there are none
* Named routes (do a Merb-style url method and then make whatever\_path / whatever\_url use that)
* Errr remember what the mystery arg does...
* Reloading
* Test on Ruby 1.9
